\end{center}

Great Smog of London (1952)
========================================================
+ Sources
    + Cold weather led residents to burn extra coal [SO~2~] to stay warm
    + Inversion: 30-mile stagnant air mass (5 days in Dec)
+ Receptors
    + About 100,000 residents felt ill with respiratory symptoms
    + Estimated 4,000-12,000 excess deaths (e.g. hypoxia resulting from obstruction of air passage by lung infection pus)
+ Impact
    + Especially bad "pea-souper" as seen on TV (e.g. *The Crown*)
    + Led to UK Clean Air Act of 1956 (and 1970 in US)
    + "Landmark in air pollution epidemiology because of the scale of the disaster and because it allowed researchers to do the first detailed analysis of the relation between levels of air pollutants and increased morbidity and mortality" [(Nemery et al. 2001)](https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(00)04135-0/fulltext).

Los Angeles Smog and Clean Air Act (1970)
========================================================
+ Source
    + 1,000,000+ vehicles on LA roads by 1940
    + VOC emissions + sunlight + NO~x~ -> O~3~ (photochemical smog)
    + LA is natural trap for smog accumulation
        + Geography: flat basin between ocean and mountains
        + Weather patterns: cold ocean current creates inversions
+ Receptors
    + Respiratory and cardiovascular effects among residents
    + Crude resipiratory mortality rate was 50.8 per 100,000 in 1961 [(Mahoney 1976)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1130478/?page=3). 
+ Impact
    + Clean Air Act of 1970 set federal and state regulations to limit stationary and mobile source emissions
    + Current O~3~ levels in LA just 40% of mid-1970s levels despite more than twice the number of cars

    + [Air Quality Index](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Air_quality_index) can reach >201 [heavily or severely polluted]
+ Impact
    + Chinese government uses stricter regulations and cleaner fuels
    + US Embassy posts automated air quality @beijingair
